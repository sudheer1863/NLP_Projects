# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Projects 🗣️📊  

Welcome! 👋  

This repository contains all the **Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects** I’ve developed.  
Each project applies **text processing, machine learning, and deep learning techniques** to solve real-world problems in language understanding.  

## 📂 Repository Structure  
- Each folder represents a **separate NLP project**.  
- Projects include:  
  - Text preprocessing & tokenization  
  - Sentiment analysis  
  - Text classification  
  - Named Entity Recognition (NER)  
  - Topic modeling  
  - Machine Translation  
  - Question Answering & Chatbots  
  - Transformer-based models (BERT, GPT, etc.)  

## 🎯 Purpose  
The goal of this repo is to:  
- Explore and apply **NLP techniques** for different tasks.  
- Showcase skills in **text analytics, deep learning for language, and generative AI**.  
- Provide reference projects for learners and developers interested in NLP.  

## ⚠️ Note  
- All projects are implemented using **Python** with libraries such as:  
  - `NLTK`, `spaCy`  
  - `scikit-learn`  
  - `TensorFlow / Keras`, `PyTorch`  
  - `Hugging Face Transformers`  
- Datasets are open-source and mentioned in each project.  

## 💡 Contribution  
Suggestions, improvements, or new NLP project ideas are always welcome!  
Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
